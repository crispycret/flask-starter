# flask-starter
Prebuilt flask app with user authentication, user profile, user following and blocking support.


## Features
 * Authentication
 * User Profile
    * User Following
 * Database Support



## Generate Application Secret Key
In a python shell generate a secret token for the application. \

```
import secrets
secrets.token_hex(64)
```

Place this token in the .env file of the projects root directory.
#### .env
```
SECRET_KEY=91b47920cca5d2fce10d4096f90c0e69eceae11e0c537a263e22ff11cbacdf34c00492deb6643cf676b68efd12a781ec174ae3abbe7f8f1d83b00a8fee234927
```

## Setup SQLAlchemy Database
```
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "initial migration"
flask db upgrade
```

## Run the Application
```
flask run
```


## Responses

Requests that want to make a change but could not because the state requested is the current state returns a response status code of 409 instead of 201.
##### Example:
```
Status: 201 -> Created: A user requesting to follow another user that they are not following.
Status: 409 -> Conflict: A user requesting to follow another user, but is already following that user.
```

##### Used Status Codes:
```
400 Invalid request
401 Unauthorized
409 Conflict
200 Ok
201 Created
# 202 Accepted -> request that is returned before operation can be completed.
# 204 No content
```


## Decorators

This project comes with a set of decorators to add and simplfy common functionality sucj as user authentication and user lookups.\
These decorators return keyword arguments such as `token, current_user, target_user` or returns back to the api caller a message stating the error with a proper response code.\


Authentication is handled using decorators while providing easy access to the data required to handle authentication.\

This extends to decorators used to verify that data exists such as `@auth.views.target_user_required` which does a database lookup of a username and returns the target user in the `target_user` field. \

The same works for the decorator `@user_not_blocked_required` which requires that the `current_user` and `target_user` do not share a `UserBlock` relationship. This is helpful for when one user wants to message another user to quickly check if the message can even happen.\

For some decorators to work such as `@user_not_blocked_required` there needs to be a proper stacking of decorators that will return the required parameters.\

##### Example
```
@auth.route('/users/<username>/message', methods=['POST', 'DELETE'])
@auth.views.token_required
@auth.views.target_user_required
@user_profiles.decorators.user_not_blocked_required
def message_user(token, current_user, target_user, **kwargs):
   ...
```

#### @token_required -> return token, current_user
#### @target_lookup -> returns target_user

## API Calls
The following is an example of working API calls for this project.

### Non Authentication Calls

##### /register
###### Request
```
{
    "email":"example2@email.com",
    "username": "test002",
    "password": "testpassword"  
}
```

##### Response
A valid response can be one of the following.
```
{
    "message": "registered successfully"
}
```

```
{
    "message": "username already used"
}
```

```
{
    "message": "email already used"
}
```


### /login
#### Request
The login call expects the login information to be passed through the `Authorization` header.\
The value to the `Authroization` header should be the username and password encoded with `base64` with the format `username:password` after the word `Basic`
```
{
   'Authorization': 'Basic dGVzdDAwMTp0ZXN0cGFzc3dvcmQ='
}
```

#### Response
A successful login response will provide an authorization token for the user that lasts 1 hour.\
This token should be placed in the header `x-access-token`
```
{
    "token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJwdWJsaWNfaWQiOiJkZTk2NDNjNS02ZTQ1LTQyZWEtYTJlOS03YTA1Yjg3NmUwNTMiLCJjcmVhdGVkIjoiMjAyMi0wNS0xNVQxMjoyMzoxMi4yNzU1NTMiLCJleHBpcmVzIjoiMjAyMi0wNS0xNVQxMzoyMzoxMi4yNzU1NjYifQ.E0x5WInJirl3txAuLY8fEXNJYO_Mu0LhcR9Tp9Zt42o"
}
```

```
```
